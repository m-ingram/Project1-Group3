## Project Overview
In 1997, Major League Baseball (MLB) introduced the Competitive Balance Tax (CBT) as a measure to deter teams from exploiting a spending advantage without consequences. This initiative aims to assess team performance by considering their financial capacity, linking victories to responsible spending, and penalizing excesses through taxes. The goal is to level the playing field and prevent teams from gaining an unfair advantage in acquiring higher-quality players by overspending. 

## Project Analysis
Teams didn’t change their spending post CBT. Player salaries are minimally related to team’s win-loss records. Team performance is (at least a little bit) more balanced post CBT.

### Question 1: Did implementation of penalty system eventually discipline the teams?
Despite occasional fluctuations in the gap between teams with the highest and lowest salaries following the implementation of the CBT, the sustained increase in average salaries suggests that teams have not collectively exhibited greater fiscal discipline to circumvent CBT payments.
