## Project Overview

In 1997, Major League Baseball (MLB) introduced the Competitive Balance Tax (CBT) as a measure to deter teams from exploiting a spending advantage without consequences. The goal was to level the playing field and prevent teams from gaining an unfair advantage in acquiring higher-quality players by overspending. This project assess how the CBT may have impacted team behavior and performance.  

We use a baseball dataset compiled by Sean Lahman and shared via kaggle (see link in Credits). We limit our sample to the MLB seasons corresponding to calender years 1985 to 2015. During that time period, new teams (franchises) joined the league so we restrict our sample to the 26 teams present in all years of the study period. The resulting dataset contains 806 observations uniquely identified by year-team pair.  We supplement this data with information on the tax thresholds set by the MLB association.

## Project Analysis
Teams didn’t change their spending post CBT. Player salaries are minimally related to team’s win-loss records. Team performance is (at least a little bit) more balanced post CBT.

### Question 1: Did implementation of penalty system eventually discipline the teams?
Despite occasional fluctuations in the gap between teams with the highest and lowest salaries following the implementation of the CBT, the sustained increase in average salaries suggests that teams have not collectively exhibited greater fiscal discipline to circumvent CBT payments.

### Question 2: What was the most dominant team during the 30-year period and its correlation to salary?
-After analyzing the data, was showed that the New York Yankees (NYY) won most games during 30 years, hence being the most dominant team for a 30 years period. Potentially due to ownership and good management, by spending money on the team in order to win games.Overall, from 1985 to 2015 Teams have showed an exponential growth in salary, meaning teams are investing more in their players, however, after analyzing the data, concluded that there is no correlation between wins and salary spent per each team. One Example is (ANA), which won the most games in 2014 and had a total team salary spent of approx. $121M, that same year, (SFG) won 88 games and total spent of approx.163M.
(NYY), the most dominant team, had spent the most and won the most games in 2009, however, the following year, 2010, it didn’t win the most games and still was the team that spent the most, approx. $206M. Hence, there is no correlation between wins and salary pear year for the most dominant team.
